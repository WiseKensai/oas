title: Oops! All Skirmish
---

Welcome to the home of the 1BoxGames Oops! All Skirmish (OAS) project.

The intent of OAS is to provide a miniature and setting agnostic rules set to
allow you to use any miniatures in a skirmish game.

We have a few specific design goals:

 * 1BoxGame - Everything you need to play the game should fit in a single reasonable to carry box or bag.
 * Small Scale - The game should fit on a kitchen table or better yet, a table at a pub with room for your plate of food and a beer.
 * 90 minutes - You should be able to crunch through a game in 90 minutes.
 * Simple Rules - The rules should be easy to understand and follow, without much special casing.
 * High Skill Ceiling - While simple, the game should give you a challenging puzzle to solve on the table with your opponent.

OAS is built with a core rules module, defining the basic mechanics of the
game. The Core Rules do not provide factions, flavor, unit profiles beyond some
playtest and teaching profiles. For those things, OAS must be extended with
game modules.
